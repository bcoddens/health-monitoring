## Health Metrics to Track

### 1. **Diet and Lifestyle**
   - **Healthy Diet**: Track diet-related metrics using smart scales and manual input to monitor weight, body composition, and body fat percentage.
   - **Avoid Smoking & Limit Alcohol**: Use Home Assistant to set reminders for healthy lifestyle choices.
   - **Daily Movement**: Track steps, walking, and general activity using Garmin devices.

### 2. **Physical Health Metrics**
   - **Heart Rate**: Track resting, recovery, and training heart rates using Garmin Connect integration with Home Assistant.
   - **VO2max**: Monitor cardio fitness improvements using Garmin data automatically synced to Home Assistant.
   - **Blood Pressure**: If you have a smart blood pressure cuff, integrate it with Home Assistant for automatic logging and alerts.
   - **Body Composition**: Use Home Assistant to track weight and body fat percentage from a smart scale.
   - **Grip Strength**: If you use a fitness tracker that measures grip strength, you can integrate this into your health dashboard.
   - **Flexibility & Mobility**: Track daily stretching sessions, range of motion exercises, and balance training using manual input helpers or yoga/stretching app integrations.
   - **Oral Health**: Monitor dental hygiene habits including brushing frequency, flossing, and dental check-up reminders through Home Assistant automation schedules.

   #### **Cycling-Specific Metrics**
   - **Cadence**: Track high-cadence (100-120+ RPM) sessions to improve neuromuscular efficiency using power meter data synced through Garmin Connect.
   - **Power/Torque**: Monitor power output and torque during strength-endurance rides (e.g., low-cadence hill climbs) for cycling-specific fitness development.
   - **Lactate Threshold Zones**: Track heart rate zones between LT1 and LT2 for Norwegian-style pyramidal training periodization.

### 3. **Recovery & Sleep Monitoring**
   - **Sleep**: Monitor sleep duration and quality using Garmin data automatically synced to Home Assistant for pattern analysis and alerts.
   - **Recovery Metrics**: Track HRV (Heart Rate Variability), recovery time, and stress levels from Garmin Connect integration with Home Assistant.
   - **Sleep Environment**: Monitor bedroom temperature, humidity, and noise levels using smart sensors integrated with Home Assistant.
   - **Sleep Hygiene**: Set automated reminders for consistent bedtimes and create lighting automations to support circadian rhythms.
   - **HRV-Based Readiness**: Use HRV 7-day rolling averages to assess cycling readiness and automatically adjust training load recommendations, following Alan Couzens' methodology for data-driven recovery monitoring.

### 4. **Mental & Emotional Health**
   - **Stress Levels**: Monitor stress indicators from Garmin Connect (stress score, body battery) automatically imported into Home Assistant.
   - **Mood Tracking**: Use Home Assistant input helpers to manually log daily mood and energy levels with trend analysis.
   - **Meditation & Mindfulness**: Track meditation sessions and mindfulness practice duration using timer automations in Home Assistant.
   - **Social Connection**: Monitor social activity patterns, track frequency of social interactions, and set reminders for maintaining strong relationships and social network engagement.
   - **Work-Life Balance**: Track work hours, break frequency, and time spent on leisure activities using presence detection and calendar integration.
   - **Sense of Purpose**: Use daily reflection tracking to monitor goal alignment, life satisfaction, and personal meaning metrics through Home Assistant input helpers.

### 5. **Environmental Health Factors**
   - **Air Quality**: Monitor indoor and outdoor air quality using smart sensors integrated with Home Assistant for health alerts.
   - **Temperature & Humidity**: Track optimal living conditions and receive notifications when levels affect health and comfort.
   - **Light Exposure**: Monitor natural light exposure and UV levels using weather data and smart light sensors.
   - **Noise Pollution**: Track ambient noise levels in living and working spaces using smart sound sensors.
   - **Water Quality**: If available, integrate smart water quality monitors to track hydration source quality.

## System Architecture & Data Flow

### Core Components Integration
- **Home Assistant**: Central hub receiving data from all sources and managing automations
- **Garmin Connect**: Primary source for fitness, sleep, and health metrics, including cycling-specific metrics (cadence, power, heart rate zones) via Home Assistant integration
- **Node-RED**: Data processing, custom flows, and advanced automation logic for cycling training and recovery analysis
- **Intervals.icu**: Training analysis and performance tracking integration, syncing cycling activities for detailed analytics and Alan Couzens methodology implementation
- **Smart Devices**: Scales, sensors, power meters, and IoT devices for comprehensive data collection
- **Power Meters**: Bluetooth power meters for real-time cycling performance data

### Data Flow Overview
1. **Data Collection**: Garmin devices (with power meters) → Garmin Connect → Home Assistant integration
2. **Data Processing**: Home Assistant sensors → Node-RED flows → Processed metrics (cadence trends, LT zones, HRV analysis)
3. **Data Storage**: Home Assistant recorder → InfluxDB (optional) → Long-term analytics
4. **Data Visualization**: Home Assistant dashboards → Grafana (optional) → Advanced cycling performance charts
5. **External Sync**: Training data → Intervals.icu → Cycling performance analysis and Alan Couzens methodology tracking
6. **External Integrations**: Support for external analytics and training platforms for enhanced data analysis

### Privacy Considerations
- **Local Storage**: All health data stays within your Home Assistant instance
- **Data Encryption**: Enable encryption for Home Assistant database
- **Network Security**: Use HTTPS and secure your Home Assistant installation
- **Access Control**: Configure user accounts with appropriate permissions
- **Data Sharing**: Only share anonymized data with external services when necessary
